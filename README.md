## Steps (LINUX)

Clone this repo wherever you prefer, for simplifying things I use home folder in this case.
-   `cd ~`
-   `git clone git@github.com:yebh17/gitq.git`
-   `cd gitq`

We need to make the script permanently available in the PATH, so that gitq is accessible from any path.
-   `mkdir -p ~/bin`

Copy the gitq script to the bin folder you just created.
-   `cp gitq.sh ~/bin/gitq`

Add this "bin" directory to the PATH.
-   `nano ~/.bashrc`

Add the following line at the end of the file.
-   `export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"`
Save and close the file.

###### Note: If you are using a different shell (e.g., Zsh), use the appropriate configuration file (e.g., ~/.zshrc) instead.

Ensure the script has executable permissions.
-   `chmod +x ~/bin/gitq`

To apply the changes immediately, either close and reopen your terminal or run the following in the same terminal.
-   `source ~/.bashrc`
###### Note: If you made changes to a different shell configuration file, replace "~/.bashrc" with the appropriate file path.

Now, you should be able to run the script from any location simply by typing its name, example,
-   `gitq -h`
